# Quiz Consolidation Summary

## Changes Made

### Merged Files (3 consolidations)

1. **Portuguese Oralidade** → `portugues-5o-oralidade.json` (v2)
   - Merged: `portugues-5o-oralidade.json` (18 cards) + `portugues-5o-oralidade-vocabulario.json` (12 cards)
   - Result: 30 cards, 30 distractors, 18 true/false statements
   - Reason: Both had identical unit code `PT5_ORAL`

2. **Ciências Naturais Unit 1** → `cn-5o-u1-terra-materiais.json` (v3)
   - Merged: `ciencias-u1-content.json` (34 cards) + `cn-5o-u1-materiais-terrestres.json` (12 cards)
   - Result: 46 cards, 46 distractors, 32 true/false statements
   - Reason: Both covered Unit 1 content with overlapping themes

3. **HGP Early History** → `hgp-5o-pre-historia-reconquista.json` (v2)
   - Merged: `hgp-5o-primeiros-povos-romanizacao.json` (12 cards) + `historia 5.json` (22 cards)
   - Result: 34 cards, 34 distractors, 27 true/false statements
   - Reason: Overlapping Romanization content, chronologically continuous

### Renamed Files (1 rename)

- `ingles.json` → `ingles-5o-u1-be-pronouns-vocab.json`
  - Reason: Standardize naming convention (subject-grade-unit-topic)

### Moved Files (1 relocation)
